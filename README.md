# Pet Adopter
Pet adopter is a project showing three different pages. The home page includes some information about adopting, while the other two pages include a page of dogs and cats. You can click the adopt button to "adopt" the specific pet, or "rehome" the pet after clicking the button a second time. You can also add a pet by typing in a name and image in the form and clicking submit. This showcases 5 or more react componenets, and GET and POST examples with the db.json file of dogs and cats.
